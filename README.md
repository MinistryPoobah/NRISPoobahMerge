# NRISPoobahMerge

# The script reads in the NRIS Inspections csv, NRIS Complaints csv, and Poobah data xlsx for cleaning, filtering, and merging.
# The NRIS Inspections data are merged with the Poobah data to update the Poobah file with the most recent inspection status.
# The processed data are saved to a local file as well as uploaded to Google Drive. The uploaded file overwrites the previous
# Google Drive file and retains the same id. 

# This script was inspired by a Backroads Brewery's Pale Ale and everything at Tailout Brewery.
